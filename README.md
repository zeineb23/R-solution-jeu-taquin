# Resolution-jeu-taquin

Welcome to the Resolution-jeu-taquin project! This project aims to solve the game of Taquin using breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms.

## Description

The Resolution-jeu-taquin project contains two Python files:

- **rechercheLargeur.py**: This file contains an implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm to solve the Taquin game. The initial state of the Taquin is defined within the code, and the algorithm attempts to find the solution by traversing the state tree of the game.

- **rechercheProfondeur.py**: This file contains an implementation of the depth-first search algorithm to solve the Taquin game. Similar to rechercheLargeur.py, the initial state of the Taquin is defined within the code, and the algorithm searches for a solution in depth.

## Usage

To use the Taquin game-solving algorithms, run the Python files in your local Python environment.

Example usage:

```bash
python rechercheLargeur.py
```

or 
```bash
python rechercheProfondeur.py
```
Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the files.
